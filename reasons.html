        <h2>Reasons for Inequality in Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Poverty and limited resources</strong>: Families in poverty often cannot afford essential educational resources such as books, internet access, or transportation. This lack of resources prevents children from accessing quality education and often results in overcrowded and underfunded schools.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographical disparities</strong>: Children in rural or remote areas may have to travel long distances to attend school or may not have schools nearby at all. This geographical divide means that children in these areas often have fewer educational opportunities than their urban counterparts.</li>
            <li><strong>Social and gender biases</strong>: Discrimination based on gender, race, or social status can prevent marginalized groups, such as girls or minorities, from receiving an education. Cultural norms and biases can limit access to schooling and perpetuate systemic inequalities.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of infrastructure and access to schools</strong>: Many schools, especially in underdeveloped areas, lack basic infrastructure like adequate classrooms, reliable transportation, and access to quality teachers.</li>
        </ul>
