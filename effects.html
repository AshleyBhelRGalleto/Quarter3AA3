    <h2>Effects of Poor Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited job opportunities and lower income</strong>: Individuals with poor education often struggle to qualify for skilled jobs, which results in limited career options and lower income, making it difficult for them to improve their economic status.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased inequality and social unrest</strong>: Poor education can perpetuate cycles of inequality, as people from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to access quality education. This leads to widening economic gaps and may contribute to social unrest, as people demand more equal opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Impaired personal and community development</strong>: When people do not receive a quality education, they often lack the skills necessary for personal growth and critical thinking. This, in turn, affects the development of communities by reducing the availability of educated leaders and skilled workers, which hinders overall societal progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Effects for Inequality in Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Poverty and limited resources</strong>: Families in poverty often cannot afford essential educational resources such as books, internet access, or transportation. This lack of resources prevents children from accessing quality education and often results in overcrowded and underfunded schools.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographical disparities</strong>: Children in rural or remote areas may have to travel long distances to attend school or may not have schools nearby at all. This geographical divide means that children in these areas often have fewer educational opportunities than their urban counterparts.</li>
        <li><strong>Social and gender biases</strong>: Discrimination based on gender, race, or social status can prevent marginalized groups, such as girls or minorities, from receiving an education. Cultural norms and biases can limit access to schooling and perpetuate systemic inequalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of infrastructure and access to schools</strong>: Many schools, especially in underdeveloped areas, lack basic infrastructure like adequate classrooms, reliable transportation, and access to quality teachers. This makes it difficult for students in these regions to receive the education they deserve.</li>
